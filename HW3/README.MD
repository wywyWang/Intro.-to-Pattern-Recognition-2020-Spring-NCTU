## HW3: Decision Tree and Random Forest, due date: May 22, 23:59

### Goals

In this coding assignment, you need to implement the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm by using only NumPy, then train your implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data. Find the sample code and data on the GitHub page

Please note that only NumPy can be used to implement your model, you will get no points by simply calling sklearn.tree.DecsionTreeClassifier.
