## HW2: Linear Discriminant Analysis, due date: May 8, 23:59

### Goals
In hw2, you need to implement Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant by using only numpy, then train your implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data

Please note that only **NUMPY** can be used to implement your model, you will get no points by simply calling sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
